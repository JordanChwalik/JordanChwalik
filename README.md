- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JordanChwalik
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to program in Java at BYU
- Because I am a student and my repositories are primarily filled with class projects I have chosen to make all of my repositories privateto prevent plagarism.
I am however happy to show my code to anyone who requests to see it, assuming you are not a student in a class for the code you are asking to see.
